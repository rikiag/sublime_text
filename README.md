EJS 2
-----

  Thanks for installing EJS 2 :)
  
  Here are some tips to help you get started with this package:
  
  
  ### Color Scheme
  
  EJS 2 comes with the "Dracula EJS" color scheme which you can select from:
  `Preferences` -> `Color Scheme` -> `EJS 2`.
  
  Oceanic Next (https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme) is also a
  good color scheme for EJS that works right out of the box.
  
  
  ### Setting the default syntax
  
  By default, files with the extension `.ejs` are opened with the `EJS (<% %>)` syntax.
  
  If you'd like to open files with a different extension as EJS or you want to use delimiters
  other than "<% %>", follow these steps to set the default EJS syntax for an extension:
  
  1. Open an EJS file
  2. Select `View` from the menu
  3. Then `Syntax` -> `Open all with current extension as...` -> `EJS 2` -> `EJS (<delimiter>)`
  4. Repeat this for each extension you want to open as EJS
  
  This package includes syntax definitions for the following additional delimiters: `<? ?>`, `<$ $>`, `<@ @>`.
  
  
  ### Snippets
  
  In the HTML scope:
  
  + `if`+`TAB` - Inserts EJS `if` statement
  + `for`+`TAB` - Inserts EJS `for` loop

Emmet
-----

  Thank you for installing Emmet -- a toolkit that can greatly improve your workflow. Note that this plugin automatically downloads and installs PyV8 binary (see status bar message). 
  
  ******************************
  Please restart editor 
  to finish installation process 
  after PyV8 was downloaded.
  ******************************
  
  Tab key handler
  ==========================
  
  By default, Emmet allows you to expand abbreviations with Tab key in HTML, XML, HAML and CSS/SASS/LESS/Stylus documents. As a side effect, you canât use some of your ST2 snippets.
  
  Please read https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime#tab-key-handler about how Tab handler works and how to tweak its behavior to match your needs.
  
  Enter key
  ==========================
  
  In HTML and XML documents, Emmet overrides Enter key to insert formatted line breaks between opening and closing tags. In some cases it will break character input (for example, in Japanese language).
  
  To disable Enter key handler, simply add the following option in your user's Preferences file:
  
  "disable_formatted_linebreak": true
  
  Actions shortcuts
  ==========================
  
  Emmet has a number of actions with keyboard shortcuts that may override ones you're using commonly (for example, Ctrl-E or Ctrl-Down). Please read the project main page to get list of available actions and keyboard shortcuts and how to disable them:
  https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime

Color Highlighter
-----------------

  
  Color Highlighter v8.0 is released!
  
  For more info about the plugin visit https://github.com/Monnoroch/ColorHighlighter.
  
  Color Highlighter was developed for many years and features were added without consideration.
  As a result it has plenty of bugs and code is completely unmaintainable.
  Because of it, I've decided to rewrite the plugin from scratch using all the good programming practices I learned
  over the years.
  
  This is the first release of the new version and it might have some subtle bugs, especially on Windows and Mac, as I
  don't have machines with these systems. If you find any bugs, please file them in
  the bug tracker here: https://github.com/Monnoroch/ColorHighlighter/issues. I always appreciate your help and try to fix
  problems as soon as possible.
  
  The plugin is being developed by me alone in my spare time, so if you want to encourage me to build it
  better and faster, donations as always welcome.
  
  Thank you guys for your support, every little bit helps!

  ```
  
  This package adds file specific icons to Sublime Text for improved visual grepping. 
  It's heavily inspired by Atom File Icons.
  
  ***
  
  1. Please restart Sublime Text for the applied icons to take effect.
  2. The icons for packages provided by the community require to be installed. 
     E.g. if you want to see SCSS icon you should install one of the SCSS syntax packages.
