# sublime_text

this is my setting for customize sublime text 3.

How to use:
1. Install Package Control for Sublime Text 3:
   Link: https://packagecontrol.io/installation#st3
   
2. Close Sublime Text 3.
   
4. Put all this file to your oun Sublime Text 3 folder.

5. Open your Sublime text 3, and wait for download proccess.

6. Optional:
   I user Cmder for windows. So if you want to use it, please
   configure your terminal preference to:
   
   {
      // The command to execute for the terminal, leave blank for the OS default
      // See https://github.com/wbond/sublime_terminal#examples for examples
      "terminal": "C:\\cmder\\Cmder.exe",

      // A list of default parameters to pass to the terminal, this can be
      // overridden by passing the "parameters" key with a list value to the args
      // dict when calling the "open_terminal" or "open_terminal_project_folder"
      // commands
      "parameters": ["/START", "%CWD%"],

      // An environment variables changeset. Default environment variables used for the
      // terminal are inherited from sublime. Use this mapping to overwrite/unset. Use
      // null value to indicate that the environment variable should be unset.
      "env": {}
    }

7. Enjoy it.
